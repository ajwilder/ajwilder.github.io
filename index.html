      <p>
        I am a full-stack web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, jQuery/JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS. If you are looking to hire a web developer for a full-time or contract position, or for a one-time gig, check out my résumé and projects.  With a diverse background, I bring a unique perspective to web development. After years of working as a professional scientist and then a public high school teacher, I have been learning and applying web development skills full-time since June 2017.  As you can see from the projects, I have a knack for it.
