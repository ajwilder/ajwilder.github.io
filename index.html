      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a motivated and self-taught web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, jQuery/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. After years of working as a professional scientist and then a public high school teacher, I have spent the last six months learning and applying web development skills full-time. I am ready to use and expand this knowledge as a full-time web developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as technical aptitude, I bring a unique perspective to any team.  As someone who thrived for three years as a public high school teacher, I am an effective communicator with experience working alongside many personality types.  The work environment at SciMed Solutions sounds ideal.  If hired, you will find me to be fast learner and a self-starter.
