      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a motivated and self-taught web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, jQuery/JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS. After years of working as a professional scientist and then a public high school teacher, I have been learning and applying web development skills full-time since June 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am looking for a job.  That is why I built this site.  If you are looking to hire a web developer for a full-time or contract position, or for a one-time gig, check out my résumé and projects.  My email is provided on this page or in the site footer if you would like to get in contact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm, like, really smart.
