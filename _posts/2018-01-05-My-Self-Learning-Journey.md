title: My Self-Learning Journey
---
Last year, I had a realization.  It was the beginning of the school year -- my third science teacher at a public high school.  Many people had told me that the first years were tough, but after you got the hang of it, it would get easier.  Three weeks after the first day, it hit me: this job will never *not* be extremely hard and tiring for me.  I thrived as a teacher, but I am just not well suited for the extreme levels of social interaction required to be a teacher.  

I decided to finish out the school year, and move onto a new career in software development.  I always loved building websites, now I just needed to learn enough to get people to pay me to do it. So in June 2017, I taught my last class and started spending my days learning web development.  It had now been 6 months that I've been teaching myself full time. I have learned a lot.  In this blog, I plan to write some ideas about the self-learning process and software development in general.  Enjoy!
