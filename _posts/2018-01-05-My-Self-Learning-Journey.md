title: My Self-Learning Journey
---
Last year, I had a realization.  It was the beginning of the school year -- my third science teacher at a public high school.  Three weeks after the first day, it hit me: this job will never *not* be extremely hard and tiring.  With this, the next steps were clear: I would learn computer programing and start a new career.  I had always known that writing computer code could be lucrative, but I had recently realized that it could be fun too.  

I decided to finish out the school year, so I wasn't able to fully embrace the self-learning life style until 10 months later, June 2017.  It had now been 6 months that I've been teaching myself web development full time. I have learned a lot.  In this blog, I plan to write some ideas about the self-learning process and software development in general.  Enjoy!
