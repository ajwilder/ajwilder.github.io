title: My Self-Learning Journey
---
Last year, I had a realization.  It was the beginning of the school year -- my third as a science teacher at a public high school.  Many people had told me that the first few years would be tough, but after you got the hang of it, teaching is an enjoyable and rewarding career.  I was hoping that my third year I might have rounded the learning curve, but three weeks after the first day of school, it hit me: teaching will never *not* be extremely hard and tiring for me.  I am just not well suited for the extreme levels of social interaction. While teaching was enjoyable and rewarding, I wanted to find a career that didn't leave me so exhausted at the end of every day.

I decided to finish out the school year, and move onto a new career in software development.  I have always loved building websites, now I just needed to learn enough to get people to pay me to do it. So in June 2017, I taught my last class and started spending my days learning web development.  It has now been 6 months that I've been teaching myself full time. I have learned a lot.  In this blog, I plan to write some ideas about the self-learning process and software development in general.  Enjoy!
